This is a project I'm using to teach myself about compilers and get a
better understanding of the C language.

The short term goal of this project is to convert a very small subset
of C (only integers. no structs, etc.) to native x86 assembly.
Hopefully, I can find enough time to expand on this.

* Building

CMake is used to build the project. The default presets use Ninja.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. --build --preset release
#+END_SRC
